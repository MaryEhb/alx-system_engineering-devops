# Postmortem: Cloud Storage Service Outage

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** April 10, 2024, 09:00 AM (UTC) to April 11, 2024, 02:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Our cloud storage service experienced a partial outage, affecting approximately 30% of our users, resulting in slow responses and intermittent errors.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured firewall rule blocked critical traffic to the storage servers.

## Timeline

- **April 10, 2024 - 09:15 AM (UTC):** Monitoring alerts indicated increased latency and error rates.
- **Actions Taken:** Investigated server logs and network configurations assuming a network or server-side issue.
- **Misleading Paths:** Initially focused on DDoS attacks and hardware failures.
- **Escalation:** Incident escalated to the network operations and cloud infrastructure teams.
- **Resolution:** Identified and corrected the misconfigured firewall rule.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The outage was caused by a misconfigured firewall rule that blocked necessary traffic to the storage servers. We resolved the issue by updating the firewall rules to allow the required traffic, followed by extensive testing to ensure service restoration.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

1. **Automated Configuration Checks:** Develop scripts for regular firewall configuration audits.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Upgrade monitoring systems for real-time anomaly detection.
3. **Documentation Review:** Review and update network maintenance documentation.
4. **Training and Awareness:** Conduct training sessions on firewall management best practices.

## Tasks for Resolution

1. Patch firewall rules to permit necessary traffic to storage servers.
2. Conduct thorough testing to validate the fix and ensure service recovery.
3. Implement automated configuration checks for ongoing firewall monitoring.
4. Upgrade monitoring systems for real-time anomaly detection.
5. Review and update network maintenance documentation.
6. Schedule training sessions on firewall management best practices.
